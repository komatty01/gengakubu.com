		<h2 class="linetitle">About</h2>
		<p>Minami Strings is a part of the music society of Yokohama Municipal Minami High School and its affiliated Junior High School. In former days, the school's music society consisted of 4 clubs: Chorus, Brass Band, Guitar and Mandolin Club, and Strings. However, Brass Band and Strings are currently active today. We enjoy, endeavour, and collaborate with everyone who loves music. If you want to get more detailed information, please ask Maestro GANTA.</p>
